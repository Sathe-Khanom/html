        <h3><b><center>Training Service Providers (TSPs) </center></b></h3><br>
Sep 10, 2024 / IT Scholarship Programme
The actual instructor-led-training under the IsDB-BISEW project is delivered through a network of training service providers (TSPs) located in the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong. Each of the TSPs are rigorously audited and inspected before being enlisted in the project as a TSP. The primary role of the TSPs is that of providing the training infrastructure (computers, lab, etc.) and making available instructors who must satisfy IsDB-BISEW quality requirements before conducting training.

Instructors: The instructors imparting training to the IsDB-BISEW trainees in the individual TSPs have to meet and surpass clear and unambiguous criteria set by the Project Authority. In addition to academic and certification based qualifications, the quality requirements also entail the presence of the specific number of years of teaching and professional work experience on the part of the instructor. Trainees’ feedback and the Project Authority’s assessment of the instructor’s classroom performance are also taken into consideration before allowing an instructor to conduct classes for a module.

IsDB-BISEW is now utilizing the facilities of following training service providers (TSPs) in Dhaka and Chattogram for the IT Scholarship training program
